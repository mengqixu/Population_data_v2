# In this project, I am trying to generata a bar chart with the external file to show the top 10 most populated cities in China.
# I define the margins of the background and draw the x axis. 
# City names are shown in y axis and x axis is the population number.The length of each bar represents the the population.
# And when you point to the bar that you are interested in, the bar and city name will be lighted and the exact number of population will be shown.
